## 3.1 Abstract and Introduction (20%)

**Base Requirements:**
The abstract is expected to provide a precise and concise summary of the project including key results and/or achievements. The introduction should set the scene and introduce the subject area of the work. This section should include a description of and motivation for the project. Aims and objectives, and success criteria should be given. A brief description of the evaluation strategy should be included. The structure of the report is normally described. The introduction will not contain any background research – its purpose is to introduce the project to the reader.

Key assessment points:
• Demonstration of understanding the project  
• Ability to explain ideas  
• Appropriate level of technical detail  
• Aims and objectives are stated  
• Abstract summarises project and states key outcomes  
• Summary of evaluation strategy

**Outstanding (90 – 95 – 100):**
The abstract gives a precise and comprehensive overview of the project's achievements in its proper context. The introduction gives a comprehensive and precise account of the project's setting firmly based on peer-reviewed literature and derives an evaluation strategy derived from such literature.

## 3.2 Background and Theory (20%)

**Base Requirements:**
This should include a detailed description and should demonstrate an understanding of the topic/problems, and an awareness of the solutions to the technical/scientific challenges. Suitable background material and appropriate good quality references should be given that put the work of the project in context. In the main, the references should come from peer-reviewed publications. Any theory (or other detail) that is presented should be relevant, should demonstrate an understanding of the topic, and the material provided here (and in any descriptions of the design) should allow the work to be reproduced by a peer. Any background that is given should be relevant to the project and not be just 'padding'.

Key assessment points:
• Awareness of the subject area  
• Understanding of the subject area  
• Definitions and concepts are described  
• Use of peer-reviewed references

**Outstanding (90 – 95 – 100):**
There is a precise and exhaustive description of the project's setting firmly based on peer-reviewed literature. An excellent understanding of the content and relevance of the included literature is demonstrated.

## 3.3 Technical Quality, Methodology and Evaluation (20%)

**Base Requirements:**
This assesses the description of the main output from the project (for example, software, research, hardware, teaching concepts). Where appropriate, the student has used standard accepted methods of describing designs (e.g. architecture diagrams, UML, database schemas, algorithms, mathematics, etc.). Alternatively, an attempt has been made to formalise the description. This part should cover steps taken to evaluate, test or compare the work to the state of the art. Does the student demonstrate a level of understanding of the theory, design and technical aspects of the project? Key decisions should be highlighted and justified. An evaluation of the work should be included. This includes correctness, usability, fitness for purpose, ranking with similar work, and so on. It may include manual and automated testing, user surveys, and some sort of performance metric, for example. Has the student demonstrated a suitable level of critical analysis and evaluation? As many different types of project can be performed, not all of the criteria here will apply to every project. The markers will take into account what is relevant for a particular project type. In particular, a report will not be marked down for a missing criteria that is not appropriate for the project type.

Key assessment points:
• Understanding of the material  
• Technical quality  
• Requirements analysis  
• Use of design methodologies as appropriate  
• Testing as appropriate  
• Suitable evaluation of the work  
• Critical analysis

**Outstanding (90 – 95 – 100):**
In addition to the previous band: There is very little to fault. The writing demonstrates an extremely thorough understanding of the project work and the field in which it sits. Explanations of the technical details, work of the project and evaluation are exceptional.

## 3.4 Summary and Conclusions (20%)

**Base Requirements:**
This section includes the conclusions and a summary of achievements, reflection, identification of improvements, and further work. The conclusions presented must be based on the work done in the project. The suggested further work should be substantial, not simply 'more of the same'.

Key assessment points:
• Summary of the work  
• Discussion of achievements  
• Critical reflection  
• Ideas for further work  
• Alignment with abstract and introduction

**Outstanding (90 – 95 – 100):**
The summary and conclusions are excellent in precision and coverage. It is clear that the student has mastered the material and has given a definitive set of conclusions and a well thought-through plan for future work to reach definitive conclusions.

## 3.5 Presentation, Structure and Language (20%)

**Base Requirements:**
This assesses the organisation and structure of the report. Is the report laid out in a logical style with appropriate chapters, sections and subsections? Are the references complete and properly formatted? Are figures, tables and equations properly numbered and appropriate for the work? Is the report attractive (good mathematics, images of suitable resolution or scalable graphics, figures of a reasonable size)? Does the report demonstrate a proper use of the English language, how comprehensible is the prose, how clear are explanations, are there any spelling and punctuation errors, is the report professionally presented? The report should be between 10,000 – 15,000 words in length. This does not include the abstract, references and appendices.

Key assessment points:
• Structure  
• Layout and flow  
• Formatting of citations and references  
• Numbering of chapters, sections, figures, etc.  
• Suitable figures and tables  
• Grammar, spelling, punctuation  
• Report length: 10,000 – 15,000 words, unless supervisor allows exemption

**Outstanding (90 – 95 – 100):**
There is very little to fault. A broad vocabulary and a thorough understanding of the English language is evident. Beautifully presented.
