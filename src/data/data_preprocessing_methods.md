- [x] **Handling Noisy Data and Outliers**:
  - [x] **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove outliers (using 3Ïƒ rule).
  - [x] **Smoothing**: Apply moving averages or other smoothing methods to reduce noise.
  - [x] **Robust Models**: Use robust regression or ensemble methods less sensitive to anomalies.

- [x] **Handling Missing Values**:
  - [x] **Imputation Approaches**:
    - [x] **Mean Imputation**: Replace missing values with the mean of nearby data.
    - [x] **Forward Fill**: Propagate the last observed value forward.
    - [x] **KNN Imputation**: Estimate missing values using k-nearest-neighbor techniques.
    - [x] **Interpolation**: Estimate missing values by interpolating between nearby observations.
  - [x] **Data Augmentation**: Generate synthetic data points to fill in missing values.

- [x] **Handling Non-Stationarity**:
  - [x] **Differencing**: Convert non-stationary time series to stationary by differencing.
  - [x] **De-Trending**:
    - [x] **Polynomial Fitting**: Fit and remove polynomial trends.
    - [x] **Moving Averages**: Remove trends using moving average techniques.
  - [x] **Seasonal Decomposition**: Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

- [x] **Normalization Methods**:
  - [x] **Min-Max Normalization**: Scale data to a fixed range (e.g., 0 to 1).
  - [x] **Z-score Standardization**: Standardize data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
  - [x] **Logarithmic Transformation**: Apply log transformation to reduce skewness and stabilize variance.
  - [x] **Unit Normalization**: Normalize data to a unit length.
